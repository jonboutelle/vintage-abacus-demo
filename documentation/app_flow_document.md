# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is a demo React application that visually displays the current world population using an animated abacus styled like old oiled wood. The main goal is to show real-time population changes by fetching data from the official Worldometer API and then smoothly animating those changes between data updates. The app also offers a toggle to switch between showing the world population and the current national debt. The data fetching frequency starts very rapidly and then slows down over time to reduce load on the data source while still giving an engaging visual experience. The user is introduced to a visually appealing interface right at launch with a prominent animated abacus and a virtual LED indicator that monitors the health of the data fetch process.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Since this is a demo application intended to showcase data visualization and real-time updates, there is no formal sign-up or sign-in process. When users open the app, they are immediately greeted with the landing page that displays the abacus display, the LED indicator for error notifications, and the toggle to switch between the world population and national debt views. Being a proof-of-concept, the app does not require account creation or authentication, letting users jump straight into the experience.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon launching the app, users are met with a clean and visually striking home page that centers around a large, detailed animated abacus. The abacus is designed with an appearance reminiscent of old oiled wood, and it is the focal point of the application. In one corner of the interface, a virtual LED indicator is visible, showing a neutral color by default and ready to change if errors occur during data fetching. A toggle button, placed prominently within the design, allows users to switch between viewing the current world population and the current national debt. Navigation is simple; all critical functions such as data viewing and error inspection are available on the main page, ensuring that users can move seamlessly between different parts of the experience without having to navigate through multiple pages.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user arrives on the home page, the first interaction is with the abacus display that starts animating based on the latest data pulled from the Worldometer API. Initially, the app performs rapid data fetching every second to capture near real-time changes. Meanwhile, the system calculates the population increase per second, ensuring that the animation flows smoothly in between backend updates. After the initial 15 seconds of rapid data refreshes (which then gradually transition to a 5-second interval during that period), the app lowers its data fetching frequency to once a minute for the following five minutes, then every 15 minutes for the next hour, and eventually every hour thereafter. This transition from frequent to less frequent data scraping happens automatically in the background without interrupting the animation.

Simultaneously, the interface is equipped with a robust error handling mechanism. If a data fetch fails, the virtual LED indicator on the display changes its color to orange, immediately alerting the user to a potential problem. Should three consecutive fetch attempts fail, the LED turns red to indicate a more serious issue. At any point, users have the option to click on a designated area or button to open a secondary window that shows raw error messages and detailed error logs, providing transparency in case troubleshooting is needed. In addition to these core interactions, the toggle functionality is seamless. A user can click the toggle to switch the display from showing the current world population to the current national debt. When toggled, the same smooth animation and visual styling are maintained, ensuring that the overall user experience remains consistent and fluid.

## Settings and Account Management

Given the nature of the demo application, there is minimal account management functionality. There are no user profiles or settings for personal information as there is no sign-up or sign-in mechanism in place. However, the app does offer a few configuration options that allow users to adjust the view between different data metrics. For example, users can switch between seeing the world population and the national debt data by clicking the toggle button, and they may also access the error log window to view recent error messages. Once users are done with these interactions, the interface naturally returns to the main real-time display without additional navigation steps.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is built with error states to handle scenarios where data fetching encounters problems. If the API call fails once, the LED indicator immediately turns orange as a warning. If there are three consecutive errors, the LED deepens to red and remains in that state to indicate a persistent issue. When any error occurs, the interface offers a way to open a dedicated window that displays the raw error messages, allowing users to inspect what went wrong. These error notifications appear as overlays or pop-up windows that do not disrupt the rest of the app’s interface. In cases where data fetching fails, the smooth animation continues using the last known rate of population increase, ensuring that the visual flow is maintained even if the actual data is momentarily outdated.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

In summary, the user journey of the application begins immediately on a visually engaging landing page with a beautifully animated abacus set against a backdrop styled to mimic old oiled wood. Users are invited to watch real-time data updates which start at a rapid pace and slowly taper off over time. The gentle animation of the abacus is driven by a calculated population increase per second, allowing for a continuously smooth visual experience. All the while, a virtual LED indicator keeps an eye on the data fetching process, signaling any errors by turning orange or red, and offering a pop-up window for detailed error messages. With an easy-to-use toggle, users can switch between viewing current world population figures and national debt figures, experiencing the app’s functionalities in a single, cohesive interface. The entire flow is designed to be intuitive and visually captivating, making it clear how each step connects to deliver a seamless demo application experience.
