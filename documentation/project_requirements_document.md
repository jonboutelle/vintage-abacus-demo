# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a demo React application that visually displays the current world population using an animated abacus. The core idea is to mimic real-time population changes by fetching data from the official Worldometer API at different intervals. Initially, the data will be fetched every second, and then the frequency of updates will decrease gradually over time. In between these API calls, the abacus will be smoothly animated based on the calculated population increase per second to ensure a continuous visual experience.

The goal of this project is to create an engaging, vintage-inspired interface that not only shows dynamic population data in real time but also switches display modes to show national debt on demand. Key success criteria include a fluid, smooth animation that reflects incremental data changes, a robust error handling system with a visual LED status indicator, and an intuitive toggle to switch between datasets. This demo is aimed at desktop users and will serve as an illustrative proof-of-concept for real-time data visualization using modern technologies.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Developing a React app with a visually appealing, old oiled wood abacus interface.

*   Implementing real-time data fetching from the Worldometer API to display current world population.

*   Establishing a dynamic data fetching frequency:

    *   Every second initially.
    *   Every 5 seconds for the first 15 seconds.
    *   Once a minute for the first 5 minutes.
    *   Once every 15 minutes for the next hour.
    *   Once every hour thereafter.

*   Calculating the "population increase per second" by comparing the latest few values to drive smooth animations in between fetches.

*   Integrating smooth animation libraries (Framer Motion or React Spring) to provide continuous transitions.

*   Providing a toggle that lets users switch between viewing the world population and the current national debt.

*   Implementing an error handling system:

    *   A virtual LED indicator that turns orange for a single error and red if three consecutive errors occur.
    *   A mechanism (e.g., a pop-up window) to display raw error messages to the user.

*   Designing the UI to work optimally on desktop browsers.

*   Utilizing state management through React’s Context API or Zustand.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Mobile responsiveness or adapting the app for various device types besides desktop.
*   Handling high production traffic scenarios as this is a demo application.
*   Extensive historical data or additional metrics beyond the world population and national debt.
*   Unofficial or non-API methods of data collection—only the official Worldometer API will be used.
*   Implementation of additional advanced error recovery mechanisms beyond visual indicators and error logs.

## 3. User Flow

When a user opens the application, they will be greeted with an inviting interface that resembles an antique abacus made of oiled wood. The landing screen features the animated abacus along with a virtual LED indicator in a neutral state. At the top or in a prominent area, a toggle button allows the user to switch between viewing the current world population and the national debt. Behind the scenes, the app immediately initiates background processes to fetch data from the Worldometer API.

As the user watches, the abacus displays the world population with smooth animations that reflect the incremental growth between data fetches. Initially, data updates occur every second, and after the first few seconds and minutes, the frequency gradually decreases according to the predetermined schedule. If any errors occur while fetching data, the LED indicator reacts promptly—first turning orange, and then red if three failures occur consecutively—while an option to view detailed error messages becomes available. This flow ensures that users can effortlessly view real-time changes and immediately notice if there is any disruption in data fetching.

## 4. Core Features (Bullet Points)

*   **Data Fetching & Rate Adjustment:**

    *   Fetch current world population from the Worldometer API.
    *   Initial data call every second.
    *   Change frequency to every 5 seconds for the first 15 seconds.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   It is assumed that the Worldometer API is reliable and available as per its official documentation.
    *   The environment will have sufficient network capabilities to support frequent API calls initially.
    *   Developers will have access to modern browsers and a development environment integrated with Cursor.
    *   The animation libraries (Framer Motion or React Spring) will meet the performance and aesthetic needs.
    *   Basic error recovery (changing LED color and displaying error messages) is sufficient for this demo app.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits & Downtime:**

    *   The rapid initial API calls (every second) might hit rate limits or lead to temporary blocks.
    *   To mitigate this, the app includes a schedule to throttle requests over time and robust error handling via LED indicators and error logs.

*   **Error Handling Limitations:**

    *   There might be ambiguity in interpreting transient API failures as genuine errors.
    *   The LED system is designed to visually alert users but consider logging detailed error messages for clarity.

*   **Animation Performance:**

    *   Complex animations might cause performance slowdowns on lower-end desktops.
    *   Use lightweight animation libraries and optimize rendering to ensure smooth transitions.

*   **Data Inconsistencies:**

    *   Sudden drops or spikes in fetched data might result in jarring animations.
    *   Mitigation involves averaging the data points to calculate a smoother "population increase per second" before updating the animation.

*   **Implementation Complexity:**

    *   Managing dynamic intervals with changing fetch rates could lead to synchronization issues.
    *   A clear, modular approach should be taken to separate the timing, data fetching, and animation logic, ensuring maintainability and easier debugging.

This PRD serves as the comprehensive guide for developing the demo React application, ensuring that every key aspect—from data handling and dynamic updating to smooth animation and error monitoring—is clearly defined for the AI model in subsequent technical documents.
